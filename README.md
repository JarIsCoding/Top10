Jared Ly / Jesus Lares
Jared Ly - I contributed the landing page and the villans page. Using bootstrap I made the carousel, nav bar, and added responsiveness to for the different devices. Using the .d class I hid the logo when the resolution was bigger than 922px.
Jesus Lares - I contributed with figma heros page and contributed with the responsiveness for the different devices and so the images stayed the same size for every page.
