# Top10
Jared Ly / Jesus Lares
Jared Ly - I contributed the landing page and the villans page. Using bootstrap I made the carousel, nav bar, and added responsiveness to for the different devices. Using the .d class I hid the logo when the resolution was bigger than 922px.
Jesus Lares - I contributed with figma heros page and contributed with the responsiveness for the different devices and so the images stayed the same size for every page.

Top 10 Site
Peer Reviewer: Jerrod Packard
Note: Nice looking site! The carousels make things neat and simple. The text is a little tough to read on some of the slides though. I'm not sure if you're able to add a background to the text on the slides, but that would make it easier to read. I noticed that on wider screen widths, the text disappears entirely on all slides. It slides down beneath the end of the carousel and it's not possible to see it without sizing the width of my browser down. Venom's slide doesn't show any text on the picture. The text is underneath the photo and is difficult to read. Villains #7 - #1 appear below the carousel and require me to scroll down to see the photo and text. And for some reason when I leave the screen idle for a few seconds, the screen refreshes and both carousels switch back to the #10 slide. The responsiveness is a little off in tablet size on the villains page. I'm not able to use the navbar drop down to move from one page to another. When I click on the hamburger menu, it cycles to the next slide in the carousel. The heroes page seems to be working fine though and I like how the Marvel logo appears when you size the screen down. All of the video links work. Other than the weirdness with some of the slides on the carousels, I like it! Nice work you two.
